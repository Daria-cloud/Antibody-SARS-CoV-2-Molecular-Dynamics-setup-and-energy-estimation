# Antibody-SARS-CoV-2-Molecular-Dynamics-setup-and-energy-estimation
This tutorial aims to illustrate the process of setting up a simulation system containing an antibody and a SARS-CoV-2 protein, 
step by step, using the SWISS-MODEL, VMD and NAMD. The energy estimation is implemented using AutoDock Tools, scripts with commands are provided.<br>
File Tutorial.ipynb containes detailed tutorial. 
Minimized input files are in the folder 'Input structures'. The part Validation of SARS-AB on an independent dataset without crystal structures was implemented on a dataset 'Input structures/Dataset_without_crystal_structures'. The Regdanvimab analogs are in the folder 'Input structures/Regdanvimab'.
